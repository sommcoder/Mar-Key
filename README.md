# About:

Mark-Key is a small SPA to be used by the employees at Paradise Theatre in Toronto, ON designed, built and deployed by Brian Davies.

# Technical Description:

We are using React and the styled-components libary as well as exclusively function components and Hooks to control State logic.
Hooks in use:

- useState
- useRef
- useReducer

# Use Case:

It is designed to alleviate the time spent and the guess-work involved with replacing an existing marquee display with a new one.

Mar-Key dynamically looks up the user's input as they are typing to check if their input will in fact fit on the Marquee's the user has selected and also if the input is even valid.

Once all of the input has been submitted Mar-Key opens a modal window to display to the user which letters they need to retrieve from inventory, how many of them and also which letters they can simply leave on the marquee(s) to limit the amount of time and energy spent moving up and down the ladder to change the marquee.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
